# tails

Minimal Rails template for creating MVP as fast as possible. PicoCSS for styling and TailwindCSS for layout (flex, grid, gap).

```bash
bundle install
./bin/dev     # terminal 1
./bin/dev css # terminal 2
```

While developing, use `alt-b` to activate inspector. Make sure to change editor in `application.html.erb`.
